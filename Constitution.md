# OWASP-UWB CONSTITUTION
(Not yet ratified) 2019.01.31

## ARTICLE I: Name
Open Web Application Security Project, University of Washington Bothell Chapter
(abbrv. 'OWASP-UWB')

## ARTICLE II: Mission Statement
The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a 501c3 not-for-profit worldwide charitable
organization focused on improving the security of application software. Our mission is to make
application security visible, so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about
true application security risks. Everyone is free to participate in OWASP and all of our materials are
available under a free and open software license

OWASP Chapters exist to raise awareness of the OWASP mission, making application security
visible, at the local level. The OWASP Foundation encourages anyone with an interest in furthering
the OWASP mission at the local level to either get involved in their local OWASP chapter, or if
one doesnâ€™t exist, start a new OWASP chapter. Local chapter outreach is one of the most significant
ways that individuals learn about the organization and become connected to the OWASP community.
Therefore, enabling local chapter leaders and volunteers to not only hold meetings, but also contribute
to projects, organize training and events, and find new ways to evangelize about application security in
their city or region becomes a key to the success and growth of the much larger global organization.
